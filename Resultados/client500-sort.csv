A method of severing a section of an aircraft canopy so as to allow aircrew egress is necessary for aircrew safety. Past severance methods focused on fracturing materials using the shock waves created by explosive charges placed on, near or in the canopy material. These methods are effective for fracturing canopies manufactured from acrylic type materials, however, they are not reliable in severing polycarbonate type materials.
