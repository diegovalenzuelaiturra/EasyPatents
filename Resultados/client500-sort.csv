The content, given in weight percentage, of each component of the glass fibre composition is as follows: 53-64% of SiO2, more than 19% and less than 25% of Al2O3, 0.05-7% of Y2O3 + La2O3 + Gd2O3, less than or equal to 1% of Li2O + Na2O + K2O, 10-24% of CaO + MgO + SrO, 1.5-12% of CaO, less than 2% of TiO2, and less than 1.5% of Fe2O3. The composition significantly improves the elastic modulus and the chemical stability of glass, and on this basis, overcomes the problem that traditional high performance glass has a high risk of crystallisation and a high clarification difficulty, and the problem of it being difficult to perform high efficiency tank furnace production. The composition significantly reduces the liquidus temperature and the forming temperature of high performance glass, and under equal conditions, significantly reduces the crystallisation rate of glass.

These stabilized vesicles can be functionalized with either transmembrane receptors or membrane associated receptors and used for affinity pull-down assays or other chromatographic separation modalities to provide affinity capture/concentration of low abundance ligands in complex mixtures with minimal sample preparation. Further described are methods and apparatus for forming polymer frits in a fused silica capillary. The capillary containing a monomer solution is placed between one or more heat sources connected to each other via a jig and operative!y coupled to a temperature controller. The polymer frits are synthesized via thermal polymerization of the monomer solution using the heat sources, which allows for placement of the polymer frits at a spatially-defined location in the capillary.",20170216,THE ARIZONA BOARD OF REGENTS ON BEHALF OF THE UNIV OF ARIZONA [US],ASPINWALL CRAIG A [US],G01N  33/    53            A I;B01J  20/   281            A I;C07K  14/   705            A I;C07K  17/    02            A I;C07K  17/    08            A I;G01N  33/   566            A I
