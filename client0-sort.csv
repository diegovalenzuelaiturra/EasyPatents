The block and tackle units are vertically extended in an aqueous medium between supports of immovable rings of an above-water tank and a weight (ballast), and are joined to the movable units via the accumulating tank. Energy from the alternative sources in the form of compressed air or gas accumulates in a fixed braking system at a low point, connecting the movable units, of the bell-shaped accumulating tank, and a buoyancy force is produced in the latter. When the braking system is released, the tank, which can move vertically in the system, begins to move under the action of the buoyancy force or potential energy of its own weight, which results in the ropes running from one block and tackle unit over to the other, at a force equal to the acting force, which is divided by the reeving rate and multiplied by carrying out displacement of the tank at the reeving rate, from which electrical energy is produced."
