0,5.607476635514018,CN1585178A,"The system is composed of the fuel battery stack, the hydrogen as fuel to supply the subsystem, the air supple subsystem the cooling subsystem, the automatic control and the electric energy control output subsystem and the auto start apparatus. The auto start apparatus is comprised of the minitype air pump, electro-magnetic valve of the air pump, nitrogen tank, decompressing valve and electro-magnetic valve of the nitrogen bottle, minitype storage battery group. Comparing with the existed technology, the volume and weight of the invention is less heavy, which can achieve the auto start of the system."
