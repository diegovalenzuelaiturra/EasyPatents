The feedstock is quickly thermally transformed to vapor and carbon char through conventional heat exchange enhanced by physical contact of the feedstock with the hot flue gas emanating from the burner(s) providing the process heat.; The process heat burners shall be operated in a manner to produce sub-stoichiometric combustion to limit excess oxygen, thereby producing a flue gas that will displace air/oxygen from inside the conversion oven, limiting the possibility of uncontrolled combustion of the feedstock. The system does, however, include a means for introducing a controlled amount of air into the inside of the conversion oven in the event it is desired to establish a controlled burn of a small portion of the feedstock to contribute heat to the process as needed to attain the ideal temperature to thermally transform the feedstock. Derived vapor/flue gas mixture may be directly burned in a furnace to produce heat energy and/or, selectively, delivered to a liquid recovery component to produce liquid product.; When the mixture is burned there is, as a component part of the system for delivering the mixture to the furnace, a means of imparting a vigorously turbulent, cyclonic motion as it enters the combustor. The vigorously turbulent cyclonic motion assists the combustion process, attaining complete oxidation with minimum residence time. When the mixture is processed for recovery of liquid product, a portion of the carbon char derived from the thermal transformation of the feedstock and having been discharged from the oven as through a rotary airlock valve, is collected, treated for activation, and utilized as an adsorbent in the liquid recovery component.

The water that is delivered to the exhaust gas heat exchanger for conversion to steam, shall prior to its delivery to that heat exchanger, be preheated through circulation in a heat exchange system that recovers heat and cools the carbon char and some equipment such as rotary airlock valves.; Whether the derived vapor/flue gas mixture is directly burned in the combustor or selectively processed for recovery of liquid product there shall be a derived vapor/flue gas motive means that creates a negative pressure in the combustion plenums whereby combustion air may be drawn into the burner(s) without the application of forced draft blowers."
