The portable tag PT also measures a parameter related to a movement of the portable tag PT, e.g. a Doppler shift based on the received US signal. Further, the portable tag extracts the USID. Then it transmits a wireless Radio Frequency signal RFS with its own ID PTID, the USID and first and second data values D1, D2 representing the signal strength and the movement related parameters. A processor P connected to a Radio Frequency receiver RFR receives the data from the portable tag PT and determines a connection between PTID and the zone Z2 in which it is present based on the USID. Further, the processor utilizes data D1 and D2 to calculate an estimated position POS within the zone Z2.

The product of the sample, when dried and digested by an ultrasonic water bath machine, obviates the need for an organic solvent for extraction, thus reducing loss in a derivative product, reducing labor intensity, saving medicaments, and, with time being reduced, experimental results detected per the method satisfy analysis requirements for the sample, and achieving the goal of quick detection.",20170706,TIAN LINLIN [CN],TIAN LINLIN [CN],G01N  30/    02            A I
