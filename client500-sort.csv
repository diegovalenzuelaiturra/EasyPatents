1,0.06275358625373964,WO9706402A2,METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLED SMALL-CHARGE BLASTING OF HARD ROCK AND CONCRETE BY EXPLOSIVE PRESSURIZATION OF THE BOTTOM OF A DRILL HOLE,"Rock and other hard materials, such as concrete, are fragmented by a controlled small-charge blasting process. The process is accomplished by pressurizing the bottom of a drill hole in such a way as to initiate and propagate a controlled fracture or propagate any pre-existing fractures near the hole bottom. A cartridge containing an explosive charge is inserted at the bottom of a short hole drilled in the rock. The explosive charge is configured to provide the desired pressure in the hole bottom, including, if desired, a strong shock spike at the hole bottom to enhance microfracturing. The cartridge is held in place or stemmed by a massive stemming bar of high-strength material such as steel. The explosive can be initiated in a variety of ways including by a standard electric blasting cap. The cartridge incorporates additional internal volume designed to control the application of pressure in the bottom hole volume by the detonating explosive. The primary method by which the high-pressure gases are contained in the hole bottom until relieved by the opening up of controlled fractures, is by the massive inertial stemming bar which blocks the flow of gas up the drill hole except for a small leak path between the stemming bar and the drill hole walls. This small leakage can be further reduced by design features of the cartridge and of the stemming bar. The stemming bar is preferably connected to a boom mounted on a carrier. A preferred embodiment incorporates an indexing mechanism to allow both a drill and a small-charge blasting apparatus to be used on the same boom for drilling and subsequent charge insertion and firing operations. The major features of the method and apparatus are the relatively low-energy of the flyrock and the relatively small amount of explosive required to break the rock.",19970220,BOLINAS TECH INC [US],WATSON JOHN DAVID [US],E21B  43/   117            A I;E21C  37/    16            A I;F42B   3/    00            A I;F42B   3/    22            A I;F42D   1/    00            A I;F42D   1/    08            A I;F42D   3/    00            A I;F42D   3/    04            A I

A plastic cone shaped lid seals on the bottom of a can and forms a closed container. The closed container is filled with a fire suppressing agent. An activated charge displaces the shuttle. As the shuttle displaces, vertical support for the bottom cone lid is removed and a compression spring breaks a circumferential seal between the bottom lid and container sidewall, lowering the bottom lid and exposing a radial opening. Should shuttle activation fail, a lower heat deflection point of the shuttle assembly, as compared with the container, lid and center guide, afford backup activation and reliable suppression of a fire condition.",20160623,MURRAY DONALD W [US],MURRAY DONALD W [US],A62C   3/    00            A I;A62C  37/    11            A I;A62C  99/    00            A I

The present invention provides a device for improving the fuel efficiency and increasing the output of an internal combustion engine by using an output wave, the device comprising: a power unit which is input-connected to a power terminal and output-connected to a transmission terminal, and supplies power to a frequency generation unit by being connected to the power terminal; the frequency generation unit which is operated by the supplied power so as to generate a frequency; a waveform shaping unit for shaping the waveform of the frequency generated by the frequency generation unit; an output wave amplification generator which consists of a power amplification unit for amplifying the frequency shaped by the waveform shaping unit and transmits an output wave through the transmission terminal; a coil-shaped transmitter, which is installed in a suction tube of the internal combustion engine and is connected to a transmission terminal of the output wave amplification generator, for transmitting the output wave into the suction tube and vibrating moisture within the air sucked through the suction tube so as to separate the moisture into oxygen and hydrogen; and a regulator, which is connected between the transmission terminal and the transmitter, for regulating the output wave of the output wave amplification generator according to a user's request. Thus, the present invention induces complete combustion by separating the moisture in an intake air sucked into the suction tube into oxygen and hydrogen, thereby maximizing an output increase and improvement in fuel efficiency which is the efficiency of fuel consumption compared to the past. Also, the present invention removes moisture in the air through water separation and thus prevents corrosion of the internal combustion engine, thereby having an effect of pre-empting aging and life-shortening.",20170713,LIM YUN SIK [KR],LIM YUN SIK [KR],F02M  27/    08            A I;F02M  27/    04            A I

The different causes such as hitting the sharp things, explosion, hard hitting or pipe corrosion can cause to emerge such problem. For fast and easy prevention from the leakage of fluid from pipe, a clamp was designed that without needing the disconnection of the fluid current and assistance of other persons, the operator can prevent from leakage and completely repair the damaged place, using the hardeners. Considering the lever system, even one person can easily install the clamp. It is enough to open the lever handle (1) of the connector, then two clamp jaws (2) are separated from each other. Now, put the pipe between jaws (2). After bringing forward two jaw heads, an operator can easily close the clamp lever and fasten it at the earliest time by the clamp lever.
